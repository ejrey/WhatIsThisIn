# WhatIsThisIn...

Simple online converter tool that provides services such as converting weather (Celsius and Fahrenheit), gas prices (Gallon and Litres), speed units (KM/H and MPH), and currency exchange rates (using ExchangeRate-API to get the latest exchange rates) (Currency and Gas option will not work for API key is hidden). In addition, applied the NumbersAPI to showcase a fact about the resulting number.
